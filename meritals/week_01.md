### Week 1: Introduction to Web Development

#### **Overview of Web Development**

**What is Web Development?**
Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites. It encompasses several aspects, including web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. In essence, web development involves building and deploying web applications that are accessible over the internet or an intranet.

**Front-end vs. Back-end**

- **Front-end Development:** This is the part of web development that deals with the visual aspect of a websiteâ€”the part that users interact with. It involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive user interfaces.

  - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The standard language for creating web pages. It structures the content on the web.
  - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual style.
  - **JavaScript:** A programming language that enables interactive web pages. It allows developers to implement complex features such as interactive forms, animations, and dynamically updated content.
- **Back-end Development:** This is the server-side part of web development. It focuses on the functionality and logic that power a website. Back-end development involves server, database, and application interactions.

  - **Server:** Handles requests from clients (web browsers) and serves the appropriate responses.
  - **Database:** Stores and manages data that the application needs. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
  - **Server-side Programming Languages:** These include Python (with Django), Ruby (with Rails), PHP, and Node.js.

#### **Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Installing Python**
Python is a powerful, easy-to-learn programming language that's widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. To install Python:

1. **Download Python:**

   - Visit the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Install Python:**

   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - Make sure to check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

**Setting Up a Virtual Environment**
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating isolated environments for them. This is particularly useful for managing project-specific dependencies.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     ```

     Replace `myenv` with your desired virtual environment name.
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser 
     or
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

   - To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

**Introduction to IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm)**
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. They typically consist of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**

  - A free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
  - Features include syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
  - Extensions available for added functionality (e.g., Python, Django).
- **PyCharm:**

  - A dedicated Python IDE developed by JetBrains.
  - Offers code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, and integration with version control systems.
  - Supports Django and other web development frameworks out of the box.

To install VS Code or PyCharm:

- **VS Code:** Visit [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/), download, and follow the installation instructions.
- **PyCharm:** Visit [jetbrains.com/pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), download, and follow the installation instructions.

This foundational knowledge will prepare you for diving into Django and building dynamic, powerful web applications.
